In JKAN, categories on main page are using categories key in datasets sets. We're currently dumping all dataset tags into that key-set but we'll want to replace it with one of the 14 defined categories as in jkan/_data/categories.yml

- what is the current distribution in categories?
- what is the desired distribution in categories (i.e. not everything should go into "uncategorised" it should be the catchall, but 20% reasonable?)
