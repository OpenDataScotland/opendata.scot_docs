Now we can quantify how many people are accessing the service! reduced the number of categories in the datasets from 744 to 14! The category filter is now usable again automated a tiny bit more of the data listing process we've been having some really exciting conversations about how to make dataset categorisation clever-er. March 2022 we raised more issues but no commits in march. February 2022 Hack weekend at CTC25! added more sources including Public Health Scotland (PHS), Edinburgh City Council and Glasgow City Council which takes us up to 900+ datasets Refreshed data from already known sources started to look at comparing dataset movement between Jun 2021 and Feb 2022 (8 months) started archive of dataset snapshots Fixed several display errors Fixed issue where datasets of the same name but different casing would overwrite. tidied licensing categories converted some of the static graphs in /Analytics to be real-time charts tidied up data cleaning pipelines and improved documentation around it January 2022 A well-deserved break to recover from Christmas/Covid.

We recommend the second direct approach which is explained below. To add an image, Ensure you have edit rights on the repo. You can ask to be added to the team on our Slack group . Navigate to https://github.com/OpenDataScotland/jkan/tree/gh-pages/_organizations. Open the MD file for the target organization e.g. Aberdeenshire council. Click on the Edit This File (pencil symbol) to the right of the page on the light-grey bar. Find a logo - either from Wikipedia (which is good for councils etc) or from the organisation's own website. If you are using wikipedia: a. Go to Wikipedia (e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Scottish_council_logos) and find the organization. b. Click on the link, then on the logo itself. Copy the file address. If you are looking on the company website, you can load the website, then look at the site code. Look for \"logo\" and see if there is a direct link. Sometimes you need to stitch a relative path to the site root. Test that your link works in another tab. In the MD file edit the line logo: '' and add the link between the single quotes. logo: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/12/Aberdeenshire_Council.svg' Scroll down and save Add a mesasge = \"add logo\" and wait for page to rebuild Refresh opendata.scot and check.
