A massive congratulations to Jack Gilmore who bagged the Young Person's category win ! October 2022 Our source alert checks picked up that 2 publishers had uptime issues this month. We were able to inform them and monitor the situation. The uptime situation also meant we added error handling to the pipeline if a publisher call failed. Minor fix to naming issue meant we now have 31 of 32 Local Authorities listed Improved National Libraries Scotland scraper to pull multiple formats of the same dataset instead of just the first Improved display of dataset licenses Changed download links in dataset listings to show filenames instead of filetypes Added Scottish Forestry as a source Added templates for raising feature requests and bug fixes Sick of having to remember the sequence of scripts to run, added a temporary main.sh (finally!) Added docker container for running JKAN frontend on local September 2022 Hack weekend CTC27 Reached 1500 datasets listed! Added Research Data Scotland, Spatial Hub and statistics.gov.scot as sources Converted the one C# API caller script to python. Backend is now completely python Correctly retain dataset publisher information in multi-pub portals Added more dataset categories Filled in missing organisation images August 2022 Added some automated testing Added Black as our code formatter of choice Various bug fixes July 2022 Added National Libraries Scotland as a source Maintenance to prepare for depreciating functions June 2022 Presented to the Aberdeen Python User Group meetup on 8 Jun. Slides here , challenges set here and recording here May 2022 A very successful hack weekend at CTC26! 8 contributors and an estimated 120 person hours! set up monitoring alerts to auto open/close a ticket on our github project board when a publisher\u2019s url goes offline so we know to investigate. refactored API call scripts so they use a single source for publisher URLs for easier long-term maintenance successfully automated the entire pipeline using github actions exposed our web analytics by exporting to a new analytics repo created 3 web scrapers converting our manual sources into automated calls improved categorisation including a new dedicated tourism category changed the way we create URLs, from arbitary ID to org+dataset name combination. This preserves URL permanency. April 2022 Added plausible analytics to opendata.scot. Now we can quantify how many people are accessing the service! Reduced the number of categories in the datasets from 744 to 14! The category filter is now usable again Automated a tiny bit more of the data listing process We've been having some really exciting conversations about how to make dataset categorisation clever-er. March 2022 We raised more issues but no commits in march. February 2022 Hack weekend at CTC25! added more sources including Public Health Scotland (PHS), Edinburgh City Council and Glasgow City Council which takes us up to 900+ datasets Refreshed data from already known sources started to look at comparing dataset movement between Jun 2021 and Feb 2022 (8 months) started archive of dataset snapshots Fixed several display errors Fixed issue where datasets of the same name but different casing would overwrite. tidied licensing categories converted some of the static graphs in /Analytics to be real-time charts tidied up data cleaning pipelines and improved documentation around it January 2022 A well-deserved break to recover from Christmas/Covid. Milestone 22Q1: Improve Data Started December 2021 Added some datasets and organisations from wikidata improved usability of interface Attempted upgrade from Bootstrap 3 to Bootstrap 5. That didn't work out. November 2021 We had a very productive hack weekend at CTC24! closed 10 issues, opened 6 new ones 5 authors, over 200 commits, and 600 files. with thanks to other participants on another project whose work fed into OD_BODS also We have a brand new shiny working website opendata.scot (complete with footer and licensing information) Added all 427 of our known datasets to the listing (no new data refresh) The listing has filtering and search functionality (thanks to JKAN.io) Added a (nearly complete) list of 152 scottish organisations (and with logos) Made several new pages to help the Learn element of the project (Analytics, What is OD?, About) Added a form for users to suggest open datasets they want to see, and for others to see what has been suggested. Added 2 new \"how to\" guides to the wiki (adding a new page, adding an organisation image) October 2021 We now have a project plan for the next 12 months! Created a dedicated slack channel and github repo. Transferred the original CTC23 repo to its new home in the ODS organisation Centralised all our to-do lists and notes in the repo.

Fork this project This will create a clone of the project into your personal online GitHub account. Normally you should fork from the head of 'main' unless you're purposefully contribution to an existing branch. Create a branch on your fork of the project immediately. Name the branch based on the feature/fix you are about to add (branch naming format? \"BR_Fancy-new-feature\"). Each branch should try to add only one logical feature/fix. If you want to do multiple things then make a separate branch for each. This means when you later issue a pull request (PR) from this branch and you are asked to make changes these are all inside a branch. This allows you to work on multiple features and PRs in parallel without conflicts. Make your changes in the branch Often this will be over multiple commits. Try to make each commit do just one (normally fairly small) logical thing. And describe why you've made the change in the commit message. (What you've changed is clear by the code, but why is often not so clear.) Also in your commit message should be any testing you performed/ or did not perform. We use Black to format our Python code in order to adopt a PEP-8 compatible way of unambiguously formatting code. Once you have finished with your code changes, please install Black using pip install black and then run it from the root project directory using black . or python -m black . . Issue PR or Draft PR First ensure your project fork/branch is up to date with this repo. Do this by updating your 'main' branch from 'upstream remote' then update your feature branch from 'main'. This keeps your 'main' aligned with ours.(I need to check that's correct). Check your code still works as before then do either: A) If you have completed the feature/fix and think your code is ready for inclusion in the original project raise a PR from your branch to this repo. Your code will be reviewed before being accepted, you may receive a request for changes. B) If you would like a review, guidance, or help completing a feature/fix you can instead issue a Draft PR from your branch to this project. Need more guidance?
