# Project Objectives
Be the most complete and up-to-date source for locating Open Data in Scotland. 
(Starting with Local Authorities)
1. Find: Help public users find a data source they can use
* Or submit a request/suggestion if it is missing
2. Learn: Understand how OD is in Scotland
* Establish a comparable scorecard/barometer for assessing OD sources
* Help identify where provision can be improved (FAIR principles)

# What is success for this project?
* Survive until October 2022
* Active user-ship/ minimum unique X visits in 90 day period
* X click-throughs? 

# Project Plan
The plan is currently for the 12 months Oct21 - Sep22 with the intention to present the output at SODU22 and figure out next steps from there. The work is split into quarterly milestones:

Expectation of 20 hours a month, 12 months = 240 hours

* 21Q4 (End Dec 2021): Make front end more user-friendly
* 22Q1 (End Mar 2022): Fix known data source issues
* 22Q2 (End Jun 2022): Automate refreshes
* 22Q3 (End Sep 2022): Expand on sources

# History of the OD_BODS project
* 2020 Feb-Aug--- [Ian](https://github.com/watty62) started an [audit of Scottish Open Data](https://github.com/watty62/SOD/blob/master/Local_authorities.md)
* 2021 Jun--- At [CTC23](https://github.com/OpenDataScotland/the_od_bods/wiki/CTC23:-The-origins-of-the-OD_BODS-project), a group of people worked on collating the sources and adding analysis, working from Ian's original audit. The OD_BODS team is born.
* 2021 Sep--- OD_BODS is presented at the Scottish Open Data Unconference 2021 [(SODU21)](http://sodu.live/) to positive feedback and suggested that the project should continue
* 2021 Oct--- Plans are put into place to continue the project for 12 months with intention to present at SODU22.
* 2021 Oct--- [CodeTheCity](https://codethecity.org/) sponsors the opendata.scot domain for 2 years.
* 2021 Nov--- After a productive CTC24, the opendata.scot site is live with all 427 of the originally identified datasets listed.
* 2022 May--- Successful introduction of pipeline automation at CTC26 means the listing of data updates weekly on a Friday.
* to 2022 Oct--- We'll be working in-between and in concentrated efforts at CTC civic hacking events where we welcome everyone to join us if they can spare 2-12 hours of work over a weekend. Everyone and all skills welcome - there is plenty to share and learn!
