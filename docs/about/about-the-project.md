# About the project

### Project Objectives
To encourage the best use of Open Data in Scotland

1. Find: Help users find a data source they can use
    - by providing a complete and up-to-date listing of Open Data in Scotland
    - or recording a request/ suggestion if it is missing
2. Learn: Understand how Open Data is in Scotland
    - establish a comparable scorecard/barometer for assessing OD sources
    - help identify where provision can be improved 
3. Showcase: Promote the projects using these data
    - demonstrate where and how Open Data use is returning value
    - build a view of what good Open Data use looks like
4. Connect: Close the feedback loop
    - encourage good information flows between the 3 main stakeholder groups in the Open Data ecosystem: publishers, super users, and public users

- 2021 Jun--- At [CTC23](https://codethecity.org/2021/06/13/3689/), a group of people worked on collating the sources and adding analysis, working from Ian's original audit. The OD_BODS team is born.

- 2021 Oct--- [CodeTheCity](https://codethecity.org/) sponsors the opendata.scot domain for 2 years.
- 2021 Nov--- After a productive CTC24, the opendata.scot site is live with all 427 of the originally identified datasets listed.
- 2022 May--- Successful introduction of pipeline automation at CTC26 means the listing of data updates weekly on a Friday.
