# Project log

### December 2022
- Created a project plan for 2023
- Ran a Christmas Sprint to round up work for the year
    - Improved dataset categorisation by categorising on dataset Title and Descriptions instead of the former publisher-provided categories


### November 2022
- Published our dedicated docs subdomain [https://docs.opendata.scot/](https://docs.opendata.scot/)
- Shortlisted at the [OpenUK awards in 3 categories](https://medium.com/@kar.jewell/open-data-scotland-at-the-openuk-awards-2022-c89164fc4e23) for Software, Young Person and Individual. A massive congratulations to Jack Gilmore who bagged the [Young Person's category win](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gilmorejc_openukaward-activity-7004046432227704833-kLib?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)!

### October 2022
- Our source alert checks picked up that 2 publishers had uptime issues this month. We were able to inform them and monitor the situation.
- The uptime situation also meant we added error handling to the pipeline if a publisher call failed.
- Minor fix to naming issue meant we now have 31 of 32 Local Authorities listed
- Improved National Libraries Scotland scraper to pull multiple formats of the same dataset instead of just the first
- Improved display of dataset licenses
- Changed download links in dataset listings to show filenames instead of filetypes
- Added Scottish Forestry as a source
- Added templates for raising feature requests and bug fixes
- Sick of having to remember the sequence of scripts to run, added a temporary main.sh (finally!)
- Added docker container for running JKAN frontend on local



### September 2022
- Hack weekend CTC27
    - Reached 1500 datasets listed!
    - Added Research Data Scotland, Spatial Hub and statistics.gov.scot as sources
    - Converted the one C# API caller script to python. Backend is now completely python
    - Correctly retain dataset publisher information in multi-pub portals
    - Added more dataset categories
    - Filled in missing organisation images


### August 2022
- Added some automated testing
- Added Black as our code formatter of choice
- Various bug fixes

### July 2022
- Added National Libraries Scotland as a source
- Maintenance to prepare for depreciating functions


### June 2022

[Slides here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LEngLvSD7kPS95VVZzdJ8BGFI32jykuvweiykjxPw3E/edit#slide=id.p),  [challenges set here](https://github.com/PythonAberdeen/user_group/blob/master/2022-06/README.md) and [recording here](https://youtu.be/BkObqn-ViUs)



### May 2022
- A very successful hack weekend at CTC26!
    - 8 contributors and an estimated 120 person hours!
    - set up monitoring alerts to auto open/close a ticket on our github project board when a publisherâ€™s url goes offline so we know to investigate. 
    - refactored API call scripts so they use a single source for publisher URLs for easier long-term maintenance
    - successfully automated the entire pipeline using github actions 
    - exposed our web analytics by exporting to a new [analytics repo](https://github.com/OpenDataScotland/opendata.scot_analytics)
    - created 3 web scrapers converting our manual sources into automated calls
    - improved categorisation including a new dedicated tourism category
    - changed the way we create URLs, from arbitary ID to org+dataset name combination. This preserves URL permanency.



### April 2022
- Added plausible analytics to opendata.scot. Now we can quantify how many people are accessing the service! 
- Reduced the number of categories in the datasets from 744 to 14! The category filter is now usable again
- Automated a tiny bit more of the data listing process
- We've been having some really exciting conversations about how to make dataset categorisation clever-er.

### March 2022
- We raised more issues but no commits in march.

### February 2022
- Hack weekend at CTC25!
- added more sources including Public Health Scotland (PHS), Edinburgh City Council and Glasgow City Council which takes us up to 900+ datasets
- Refreshed data from already known sources
- started to look at comparing dataset movement between Jun 2021 and Feb 2022 (8 months)
- started archive of dataset snapshots
- Fixed several display errors
- Fixed issue where datasets of the same name but different casing would overwrite.
- tidied licensing categories
- converted some of the static graphs in /Analytics to be real-time charts
- tidied up data cleaning pipelines and improved documentation around it

### January 2022
- A well-deserved break to recover from Christmas/Covid.
- Milestone 22Q1: Improve Data Started

### December 2021
- Added some datasets and organisations from wikidata
- improved usability of interface
- Attempted upgrade from Bootstrap 3 to Bootstrap 5. That didn't work out.

### November 2021
- We had a very productive hack weekend at CTC24!
    - closed 10 issues, opened 6 new ones
    - 5 authors, over 200 commits, and 600 files.
    - with thanks to other participants on another project whose work fed into OD_BODS also
- We have a brand new shiny working website [opendata.scot](www.opendata.scot) (complete with footer and licensing information)
- Added all 427 of our known datasets to the listing (no new data refresh)
- The listing has filtering and search functionality (thanks to JKAN.io)
- Added a (nearly complete) list of 152 scottish organisations (and with logos)
- Made several new pages to help the Learn element of the project (Analytics, What is OD?, About)
- Added a form for users to suggest open datasets they want to see, and for others to see what has been suggested.
- Added 2 new "how to" guides to the wiki (adding a new page, adding an organisation image)

### October 2021
- We now have a project plan for the next 12 months! 
- Created a dedicated slack channel and github repo.
- Transferred the original CTC23 repo to its new home in the ODS organisation
- Centralised all our to-do lists and notes in the repo.
- This repo is now the brain of the project.
- We bought a new custom domain www.opendata.scot!
- We started trialing the open source JKAN.io to use as our front-end
- Preparation now underway for mini-projects to run at CTC24 - exciting!
